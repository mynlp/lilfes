<!-- Feature Structure -->
<h2><a name="feature_structure">Feature Structure</a></h2>

<p><key>Feature Structure</key>(<key>FS</key>) is a Directed Graph, in which all the nodes and              
edges have an associated name. The name associated with a node is called <a href="#type_hierarchy">Type</a>             
and the name associated with a edge is called <a href="#feature">Feature</a>.             
             
The types of edges or attributes that can be associated with a node are determined uniquely by the Type.

<p>The left most node 'Racing Horse' (with the arrow in front) is a special node         
called the Root node. Every Feature Structure must have a Root node. 'Hail to         
Reason' is connected to by two edges. This type of structure is called             
<a href="#structure_sharing">Structure Sharing</a>．</p>            
            
<p>Since it is difficult and time consuming to represent the feature structures         
by drawing graphs, the following representation called as Attribute-Value Matrix         
(AVM) is used.</p>

<p>The lines above represent the supertype-subtype relation. In the figure  
above, the lower direction is the supertype and the upper direction is subtype. All types, (except <a href="#bottom">'bot'</a>)  
have necessarily at least one supertype.&nbsp; In LiLFes,&nbsp;<a name="bottom">  
'<key><code>bot</code></key>'(<key>bottom, predefined)</a>,&nbsp; is the supertype of  
of all the types.</p>

<h2><a name="type_unification">Type Unification</a></h2>            
            
<p>The operation between different data types is defined as unification. As can  
be easily seen from the above figure, the process of finding the common parent  
or subtype is called as Unification. It is also called as <key>LUB</key>(<key>Least Upper Bound</key>).</p>            
            
<p>Let us assume we have two types <var>X,Y</var>，and we unify in LiLFeS :            
            
<blockquote>            
<code>            
<pre>
X = Y
</pre>            
</code>            
</blockquote>            
            
For example，             
<a href="#figure_triangle">in the above figure</a>            
            
<blockquote>            
<table border="0">            
<tr><td>            
<code>            
<pre>
&gt; ?- X = Triangle, X = Isometric.
X: Isometric
&gt; ?- X = Isometric, X = Right Angle Triangle.
X: Isometric Right Angle Triangle
&gt; ?- X = Equilateral, X = Right Angle Triangle.
no

</td></tr>

</blockquote>            
            
If no common subtype exists, the function fails. Since             
<a href="#bottom">'bot'</a> is supertype of all types, unification will always  
succeed and unification of bot with X will always be X.<p>In LiLFeS Type  
Hierarchy, the unification must always always be LUB i.e., it does not allow  
type types having common multiple subtypes, that too with no supertype-subtype  
relation. For example, in the above figure, it is not possible to define a new  
supertype for Isometric and Right Angle triangle, which makes LiLFeS more rigid,  
error-free&nbsp; and efficient compared to PROLOG.</p>

<h2><a name="feature">Feature</a></h2>            
            
<p>Each node can have Feature associated. If a supertype has a feature all  
children will have the feature inherited. When a node has multiple supertype(s)  
with the same feature, it will be inherited only once. In LiLFeS it is not  
possible to define the same name more than two times.</p>            
            
<p>Values in brackets are Feature&nbsp;</p>

<h2><a name="structure_sharing">Structure Sharing</a></h2>            
            
<p>Feature Structure can be thought of as a graph. Unlike a tree, multiple edges  
can point to a single node, which is refered to as Structure Sharing. In our <a href="#figure_fs">First  
Example </a>, node 'Hail to Reason' is sharing structure and while displaying it  
in AVM, dag $x (where x is number) is used and only expanded in once and  
suppressed in other places. Unification of shared structures is also possible.  
For example unification of the following:</p>            
            
<p>　          
          
<blockquote>          
<table border="0">

|_C:bot    _|</pre>          
<pre>
|~example  ~|
| A:bot     |
| B:$2 bot  |
|_C:$2     _|

</td></tr>          
</table>          
</blockquote>          
          
When Feature A is unified, since A and B feature's are shared and also B and C  
feature's are shared the result of unification will be&nbsp;

<p>LiLFeS can handle lists in the same way than PROLOG.</p>

<p>Lists are also Feature Structure. The type of the list is 'list', and have as direct subtypes 'cons' and 'nil' and 'cons' have the features 'hd' and 'tl'.      
'hd' would be the equivalent to 'car' in LISP and 'tl' to 'cdr'. Thus the above 
will be represented in Feature Structure as:</p>          
          
<blockquote>

</blockquote>          
          
<p>List being a Feature Structure can also contains structure sharing.. For       
example, in the next example，a alternating infinite series of 1, 2 can be  
represented:</p>           
           
<blockquote>
