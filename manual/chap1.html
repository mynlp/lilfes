<h1>What is LiLFeS?</h1>

<a href="chap1.ja.html">Japanese version</a>

<p>
LiLFeS is a programming system for linguistic formalisms based on
typed feature structures.  Programming language of LiLFeS is similar
to PROLOG and is designed for easy writing of <em><a
href="chap3.html">typed feature structures</a></em> as builtin data
structure.  LiLFeS can be used as a core system for developing
practical natural language processing systems, since it incorporates
variables, types, feature value restrictions and equations at the term
level. Its syntax also includes disjunction, negation and cut,
following the ordinary Prolog syntax. Built-in predicates such as copy
of feature structures, assertion, lazy evaluation, multi-dimensional
arrays and findall predicates are provided.

<p>
LiLFeS can be a core system for practical systems also in terms of its
efficiency because LiLFeS provides an engine for efficient execution
of programs with feature structure unification.  Definite clause
programs and feature structure descriptions are compiled into byte
code prior to execution.  The core engine of the LiLFeS runtime system
is an abstract machine, which allows efficient execution of compiled
code.
